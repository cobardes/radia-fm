You are building an interactive playlist. These are the songs that have played so far, and why they were selected:

{previousPlaylist}

## Context

In this scenario, you are doing a "deep dive". This means you are focusing on the discography and influences of {artist}. Aim for a 60/40 split between songs by {artist} and songs by other artists, interweaving them. Introduce 2 or 3 deep cuts into the mix.

## Objective

Find 10 good songs to follow up, and thoroughly explain each choice in a single paragraph about 150 words long. Include interesting facts when relevant. Use diverse criteria such as artists and producers involved, genres, decades, influences, etc. Do not focus excessively on the lyrics of the songs.

## Notes

- Make a selection where each song flows in some way with the next.
- Avoid "closing" the playlist at no. 10. We will continue to add more songs.
- Do not write any introductions or conclusions. Only do song + reasoning combos.
